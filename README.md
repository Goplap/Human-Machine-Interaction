# Human-Machine-Interaction
The Arduino board controls the electronics (diodes and a button). The other board (ESP8266) interacts with the user via the app and Wi-Fi. These boards communicate with each other via Serial. That is, one board is responsible for controlling the electronics, and the other board is responsible for interacting with the user.
